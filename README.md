# ComponentSearcher

This was a small company project and the main objective of the project was to design a computer program which searches for part numbers stored on an Excel Spreadsheet, on a server. The program has many unique features it allows entries to be searched based on Part number, name and description of items. It also displays the part number's location of where they would be stored in the warehouse in the company's building and it also records the quantity of the items. 

As well as recording the quantities it allows you to take items out of stock and add items to the stock. 

Here is an image of the GUI. The main code for the GUI can be viewed by clicking [here](/GUIcode/Form1.cs).
