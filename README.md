# ComponentSearcher

This was a small side project designed for a friend who wanted to have a program which can search for electronic components, by part number and then have the location information show up on a screen. Each electronic component has been organised and placed in a designated draw and the information has been stored on an Excel Spreadsheet. The program has many unique features it allows for entries to be searched based on Part number, name and description of items. It also displays the part number's location of where they would be stored in a designated cabinet and as well as the quantity of the components.   

As well as recording the quantities it allows you to take items out of stock and add items to the stock. 

Here is an image of the GUI. The main code for the GUI can be viewed by clicking [here](/GUIcode/Form1.cs).
